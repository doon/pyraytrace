# pyraytrace

Jamis Buck has a new book called The Ray Tracer Challenge (https://pragprog.com/book/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge)

I've always been intrigued by ray tracing (every since getting a copy of PovRay in the early 90's), and I need to practice my python.
So here we are.  Expect crappy code, but I am having fun.. 

Feel Free to do what you want with this..
